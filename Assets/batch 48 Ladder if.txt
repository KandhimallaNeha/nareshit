1) Write a C program to check whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene triangle.
-------  
         Validity Check:
         If all three sides are equal then the triangle is equilateral.
         If exactly two sides are equal then the triangle is isosceles.
         If all sides are different then the triangle is scalene.

Sample input :  Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:
                Side 1: 3
                Side 2: 3
                Side 3: 3
Sample output : The triangle is equilateral.


Sample input :  Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:
                Side 1: 5
                Side 2: 5
                Side 3: 8
Sample output : The triangle is isosceles.


Sample input : Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:
                Side 1: 3
                Side 2: 4
                Side 3: 5
Sample output : The triangle is scalene.


Sample input : Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:
                Side 1: 1
                Side 2: 2
                Side 3: 3
Sample output : The triangle is not valid.

Que 2 : Rajesh bought an old TV for $3500. and Rajesh sold the TV for $7000, which includes a 5% VAT and a 10% tax on the selling price. 
-------  Calculate the net selling price by removing VAT and tax.
         Determine whether Rajesh made a profit or incurred a loss, and calculate the respective amount.

         Program Requirements:

         The program should read the cost price and the total selling price (including VAT and tax).
         The program should calculate the net selling price by removing VAT and tax.
         The program should compare the net selling price with the cost price to determine profit or loss.
         The program should display the amount of profit or loss.

Sample input  : Enter the cost price of the TV: 3500
                Enter the selling price of the TV (including VAT and tax): 7000
Sample output : You made a profit of 1956.52
